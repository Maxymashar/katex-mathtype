# Mathematical Typography Study Using KaTeX (MTSUK)

This is a web tool for studying mathematical typography things such as

 - The spacing between characters
 - How characters change with font size
 - How the angles of certain symbols such as the square root and angle bracket change
 - How the font sizes change from the parent to the child
 - Get the width,height,length of different combined symbols such as the arrows at different lenghts
 - 


## With this tool + DEV_TOOLS we should be able to

 - Change the font-sizes of the characters and see how it changes their relations
 - Get all the relations of Mathematical symbols ie, The spacing of the characters
 - Measure the lenghts of divs and spans used to create symbols such as arrows
 - Measure the bounding box of a given character at a given font
 - Use scale(x) to change the font-sizes of the characters and the measuring-boxes at the same time
 - and More
